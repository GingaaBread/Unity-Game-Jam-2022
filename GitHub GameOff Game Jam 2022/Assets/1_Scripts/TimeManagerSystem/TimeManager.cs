/*
This class owns...
- The source of truth for current time, made available to other classes via TimeManager.time
- Updating the time at the start of the computer phase
- Firing events (OnStartPreTurn, OnStartPlayerTurn, OnEndPlayerTurn)
- During computer phase, Syncronously calls various other systems during 
    computer phase to do their work (like a tile manager, time displayer, and probably a dozen others). 
    To make this easy to update, TimeManager will have a public array of classes which extend ComputerPhaseStep
    and therefore must implement ComputerPhaseStep.ProcessComputerPhase()
