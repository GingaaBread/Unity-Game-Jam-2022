  lines:
  - 'Hi, my name is Perry! I''m a local grocer.

    If you want, I''ll help you
    start setting up your farm. '
  - 'Let''s start with planting your first crops. You''ll see you have some cards
    in your hand.

'
  - Each one represents a farm resource, like an acre you can plow or a crop you
    can plant.
  - 'Each turn, you''ll get new cards to replace the ones you played. You can have
    a maximum of five cards in your hand. '
  - 'There are 3 types of cards: building cards, livestock cards, and crop cards. '
  - Building cards can only be placed on hill or plain tiles, livestock cards can
    only be placed on top of animal pens, and crop cards can only be placed on free
    acres.
  - 'Speaking of tiles, as a new farmer you should try and get acquainted with the
    different types of land on your farm. Here is a handy guide for reference! '
  - Watch out for seasons too! They will affect your crop growth in unexpected ways.
    Be sure to pay attention to the extra details of your cards.
  - 'When your crops are done growing or your animals have created a product, all
    the resources will be collect automatically. '
  - All resources end up in the store. There you can sell them to earn coins and
    use those coins to plant more crops. It seems like an ideal business!
  - Resources are located on the left and local grocers are on the right. You'll
    find me there too! I buy crops for Pafort ctiy.
  - Most grocers only want to buy one resource each season but, since we're friends,
    I'll buy two. The second one I can only buy at half price though, sorry. I'm
    not made of money! Haha
  - 'The other grocers all have their own area of specialty. For instance.

    Emile
    will always buy crops at a premium.  Get to know each of us better and learn
    our quirks!'
  - 'Now that the business part is done, you''re all set up and ready to go! You
    can see the requirements of the bet here whenever you want. '
  - ' I wish you the best of luck! Win that bet for all of us, okay? I know you''ll
    make your mother proud. You''ve got this!'
