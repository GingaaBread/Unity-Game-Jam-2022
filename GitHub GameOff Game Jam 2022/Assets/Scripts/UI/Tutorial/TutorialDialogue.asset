  - 'Hi, my name is Perry! I''m a local grocer.

    If you want, I''ll help you
    start setting up your farm. '
  - 'Let''s start with planting your first crops. You''ll see you have some cards
    in your hand. Each one represents a farm resource, like an acre you can plow
    or a crop you can plant.

'
  - 'Each turn, you''ll get new cards to replace the ones you played. You can have
    a maximum of five cards in your hand. '
  - 'Each turn, you''ll get new cards to replace the ones you played. You can have
    a maximum of five cards in your hand. '
  - 'There are 3 types of cards: building cards, livestock cards, and crop cards. '
  - Buildings can only be placed on hill or plain tiles.
  - Livestock can only be placed in animal pens.
  - Crops can only be placed on free acres.
  - 'Speaking of tiles, as a new farmer you should get acquainted with the different
    types of land on your farm. Here is a handy guide for reference! '
  - Watch out for seasons too! They'll affect your crop growth in unexpected ways.
    Pay attention to the extra card details!

  - 'When your crops are done growing or your animals have created a product, all
    the resources will be collected automatically. '
  - All resources end up in the store. There you can sell them to earn coins and
    use those coins to plant more crops. It seems like an ideal business!
  - Resources are located on the left and local grocers are on the right. You'll
    find me there too! I buy crops for Pafort city.
  - 'Most grocers only want to buy one resource each season but, since we''re friends,
    I''ll buy two. '
  - I can only buy the second one at half price though, sorry. I'm not made of money!
    Haha.
  - 'The other grocers all have their own specialty. For instance, Emile always buys
    crops at a premium.

    Get to know each of our quirks!'
  - Now that the business part is done, you're all set up and ready to go! You can
    see the requirements of the bet here whenever you want.
  - ' I wish you the best of luck! Win for all of us, okay? I know you''ll make your
    mother proud. You''ve got this!'
